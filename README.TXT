pyFAI 
=====

pyFAI is an azimuthal integration library that tries to be fast (as fast as C and even more using OpenCL)
It is based on histogramming of the 2theta/Q position of each (center of) pixel weighted by the intensity of each pixel. 
Neighboring output bins get also a contribution of pixels next to the border  

Installation
============
pyFAI can be downloaded from the http://forge.epn-campus.eu/projects/azimuthal/files. 
Presently the source code has been distributed as a zip package and a compressed tarball. Download either one and unpack it.

e.g.
tar xvzf pyFAI-0.1.0.tar.gz
or
unzip pyFAI-0.1.0.zip

all files are unpacked into the directory pyFAI-0.0.7. To install these do

cd pyFAI-0.0.7

and install pyFAI with

python setup.py install

most likely you will need to do this with root privileges (e.g. put sudo in front of the command).
The newest development version can be obtained by checking it out from the subversion (SVN) repository. Do

svn checkout http://forge.epn-campus.eu/svn/azimuthal/pyFAI
cd pyFAI
sudo python setup.py install

If you are using MS Windows you also download a binary version packaged as executable installation files (Chose the one corresponding to your python version).


Dependencies
============

Python 2.5 or later should be compatible with python 3
For full functionality of pyFAI the following modules need to be installed.

    * numpy 		- 	http://www.numpy.org
    * scipy 		- 	http://www.scipy.org
    * matplotlib 	- 	http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
    * fabio			-	http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/files/fabio/

Ubuntu and Debian Like linux distributions:
-------------------------------------------
To use pyFAI on Ubuntu (a linux distribution based on Debian) the needed python modules can be installed either through the Synaptic Package Manager (found in System -> Administration) or using apt-get on from the command line in a terminal.
The extra ubuntu packages needed are:

    * python-numpy
    * python-scipy
    * python-matplotlib    
    * python-dev
    
Only Fabio has to be downloaded separatly and installed
    * python-fabio (from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/files/fabio/)

using apt-get these can be installed as:

sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib  python-dev  
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/files/fabio/0.0.7/squeeze/python-fabio_0.0.7-1_amd64.deb/download
sudo dpkg -i python-fabio_0.0.7-1_amd64.deb
